I am a Statistician at [Novartis](https://www.novartis.com), Switzerland. Before joinning Novartis, I was a Marie Curie fellow in the EU-funded network [IDEAS](https://www.ideas-itn.eu). I was based in [Politecnico di Torino](https://polito.it) and I was working under the supervision of [Prof. Mauro Gasparini](http://calvino.polito.it/~gasparini/) and under the co-supervision of Prof. Mourad Tighiouart ([Cedars-Sinai Medical Center](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/research/areas/biostatistics-bioinformatics.html)). I have a strong interest and great enthusiasm for methodological research to improve efficiency of the design and analysis of clinical trials.
